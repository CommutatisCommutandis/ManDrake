ManDrake
========

ManDrake is a man page editor for Mac OS X.  ManDrake uses a side-by-side display that shows the `troff` macro source in one pane and the formatted man page in the other.  The formatted view automatically updates as you edit the source.

If you're new to writing man pages, I recommend that you check out [Practical UNIX Manuals: mdoc][1] for a good overview of man page style and form and [MDOC(7)][2] for a good reference on the available formatting macros.

This project is a fork of the original by Sveinbjörn Þórðarson.  Many thanks to Sveinbjörn for this wonderful app -- it has saved me countless hours of frustration and made creating man pages tolerable, if not exactly fun.
